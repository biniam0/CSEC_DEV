Frequently asked Questions
    What is JavaScript?
        a programming language that allows developers to create interactive web pages and applications
    What can you do with it?
        Web/Mobile Application
        Real-time Networking Application
        Command-line Tools
        Games
    Where does JavaScript code run?
        On Browser which has Js Engine
        Chrome: v8
        FireFox: SpiderMonkey
    Browser and Node provide a runtime environment for Js code
    JavaScript vs ECMAScript?
        ECMAScript is a standardized specification for proglang
        Js is a programming lang that implements the ECMAScript specification

Setting up Dev Environment
JavaScript in Browser
Separation of Concern
    Separating Js, html and css code in separate files

Js in Node
    Download
    Add path to Sys var

Variables
    let - to declare
    variable name shouldn't be reserved keyword and bla bla

Constants
    declare constant vars using "const" keyword and don't change their value

Primitive Types
    String, Number, Boolean, undefined and null

Dynamic Types
    Static(var type can't change) and Dynamic(var type can change dynamically)

Objects
    is a collection of properties
    To access the items in object: 
        - using the dot notation 
        - using the bracket notation(has a benefit of accessing a property in runtime)

Arrays
    used to store many values(with the same or d/t datatypes) under a single name
    values can be accessed using indexing
    NB: cuz array is object it has d/t properties like length

Function
    set of statement that performs a task
    can take input as parameter(i think in my own word it is argument reciever)
    argument is the value we supply to a function
    NB: the default datatype of var is undefined

Type of Function
    Regular: can return anything
    Generator: return Generator object which can be paused and resumed using yield operator
    Async: return a promise which can be paused and resumed using await operator
    Async generator: returns an AsyncGenerator object; both the await and yield operators can be used


            >>>>>>ES6, ES7, ES8<<<<<<

Template Literals
    are literals delimited with backtick ( ` ) characters => `${var_name}`

Destructuring Objects
    assigns properties of an object to individual variables

Destructuring(Unpacking) Arrays
    assigns properties of an object to individual variables

Object Literal

For Loop
    for(index) - loops through a block of code a number of times
    for/in(index) - loops through the properties of an object
    for/of(value) - loops through the values of an iterable object

Spread operator
    allows us to quickly copy all or part of an 
    existing array or object into another array or object.
    
Rest operator
    to display argument as array
    allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array???

Arrow Function -> comprehension
    allow us to write shorter function syntax

Default Params
    allow named parameters to be initialized with default 
    values if no value or undefined is passed.

include()
    return true if an item in contained, otherwise return false

let and const

Import and Export
    import {data} from './es6beyond.js'
    export const data = [1,2,3,4,5];

padStart() and padEnd()
    padSart() or padEnd() - pads a string to front or end of it with another string (multiple times) 
                until it reaches a given length.
            - empty string can be padded to a string 
            - no padding happens if specified len is less than the original

Classes 
    - classes are template for js objects 
    - classes are ES6 features 
    - provides a more structured and cleaner way to work with objects compared to traditional constructor functions




















            >>>>>>>Questions<<<<<<

    - var vs let vs const
    - is Destructuring the same with unpacking in python
    - is Template Literals the same with f String
    - code -> compile with node -> interpreted -> then executed ?????
    - primitive type undefined???
    - are rest and spread operator the same??
    - why do we need Rest operator while there is spread???
    - can we pop from const array???
